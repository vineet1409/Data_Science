# Fundamentals of simple linear regression with Soccer-player Dataset


## Aim

To give a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of regression and build a simple linear
regression model in python.

## Data Description

The dataset used is the soccer player dataset. It has information about various players
from different clubs, and it provides data over ten features with a number of goals as the
target variable.


## Tech Stack

* Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy


### Approach

This project starts with a real-life example for regression analysis, with an introduction to
simple and multiple linear regression. Building the statistical foundation for the
regression, it gives a brief idea of the formula of regression. With this background,
the first regression model in python is built. Going through the interpolation and extrapolation 
also explains errors in regression and Lurking variables. The point estimators of mean and variance 
and distributions of underlying parameters are also discussed. The coefficient of determination is also 
known, and R squared is briefly explained. The project ends with diagnostics and remedial measures for 
regression with a practical explanation.
